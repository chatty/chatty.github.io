        <h1><a name="top">Local Subonly Mode (or similar)</a></h1>
        <p>You can create your own local subonly mode by ignoring all messages
            written by non-subscribers. This can also be applied to e.g. a
            manually curated list of users via the Addressbook. The ignored
            messages are collected in <code>Channels - Ignored</code>.</p>

        <p>Features used: <a href="help-settings.html#Ignore">Ignore System</a>,
            <a href="help-addressbook.html">Addressbook</a>,
            <a href="help-custom_commands.html">Custom Commands</a></p>

        <h3>Create Ignore Entry</h3>
        <p>Go to <code>Main - Settings - Ignore</code> and make sure <code>Enable Ignore</code>
            is ticked. Then add to the list (press the Plus-Button):</p>
        <p><code>!status:smb chanCat:subonly</code></p>
        <p>The <code>status:</code> prefix matches on messages by user status.
            The <code>!</code>
            in front negates the effect, so in this case it ignores users that
            are <em>not</em> a subscriber, moderator or the broadcaster of the
            channel. See the <a href="help-settings.html#Highlight_Meta_Matching">Highlight help</a>
            for more information on the <code>status:</code> prefix.</p>
        <p>The second requirement for a match is <code>chanCat:subonly</code>,
            which requires the channel the message was send in to be associated
            with the Addressbook category <code>subonly</code>. This isn't quite
            necessary, but makes it possible to toggle this Ignore list entry
            per channel.</p>

        <h3>Toggle the Addressbook category</h3>
        <p>If you used the <code>chanCat:</code> prefix as shown above, you need
            to add the <code>subonly</code> Addressbook category to a channel.
            You can either use the <code>Channels - Addressbook</code> Dialog or
            an <a href="help-addressbook.html#commands">Addressbook Command</a>.
            In both cases you have to add the <em>channel</em>, so including the
            leading <code>#</code>.</p>
        
        <p>An Addressbook command to toggle the category for a channel would be:</p>
        <p><code>/ab change #joshimuz !subonly</code></p>
        
        <p>This toggles the <code>subonly</code> category for the given channel, so
            when the category is there, it removes the category, and when the category is not there,
            it adds the category.</p>
        
        <h3>Create Custom Command to toggle Addressbook category</h3>
        <p>To do this a bit more conveniently, you can add it as a custom command. Go
            to <code>Main - Settings - Commands</code> and add the following to the
            list:</p>
        <p><code>/Toggle_Subonly /ab change #$(chan) !subonly</code></p>
        <p>If you enter <code>/Toggle_Subonly</code> (you can enter e.g.
            <code>/Tog</code> and then press <kbd>TAB</kbd> to TAB Complete the
            command), this automatically toggles the Addressbook category for
            the channel where you entered the command (<code>$(chan)</code>).</p>

        <p>To make this even more convenient, you can also add the Custom Command
            to the <code>Commands - Channel Context Menu</code> setting or
            trigger it via a button by adding it to the <code>Hotkeys</code>
            setting (selecting Custom Command as Action and entering the name of
            the added Custom Command).</p>
        
        <h3>Other uses</h3>
        <p>This could also be changed or extended to allow users manually added
            to the Addressbook. The Ignore entry could be changed to:</p>
        <p><code>!status:smb !cat:allow chanCat:subonly</code></p>
        <p>The <code>cat:</code> prefix requires the user to be associated with an Addressbook
            category, although in this case it is negated with <code>!</code>,
            so any user that has the <code>allow</code> category will <em>not</em>
            match the Ignore list entry, and thus their message will show.</p>
        
        <p>Users can be added to the category via the User Context Menu
            (right-click on a user in chat) or the ways detailed in the other
            sections above (although in this case, unlike the <code>chanCat:</code>
            prefix, the user name must be added without a leading <code>#</code>).</p>
