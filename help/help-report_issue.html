    <h1><a name="top">Report Issue</a></h1>
    <p>First of all make sure that you're running the latest version
        (<code>Help - Check for update</code> or
        <a href="https://github.com/chatty/chatty/releases">GitHub Releases</a>).
        Updating (including to a beta, if available) may already fix your issue.
        If not, then include as much information as possible in your report,
        such as:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Chatty version, Java version, OS (can be found in the output of the
            command <code>/appinfo</code>)</li>
        <li>What is the issue? Describe is thoroughly, include screenshots if
            possible.</li>
        <li>When did the issue first occur, has it occured more than once?</li>
        <li>Can you reproduce the issue, and if so how exactly? Be as clear as
            possible. Reproducing an issue is often elemental in fixing it.</li>
        <li>The complete error message (if an error message was shown).</li>
        <li>If possible, include the <a href="#log">Debug Log</a> of when the
            issue occured.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you don't include this information, it will be harder to help you.</p>
    
    <p>The best way to report an issue is usually in <a href="https://discord.gg/WTuqGeJ">the Chatty Discord</a>,
        because you're not as limited in message length as on Twitter, there are
        other people there that may be able to help and you can easily upload
        screenshots or short videos. But if you prefer,
        <a href="https://twitter.com/chattyclient">Twitter</a> and
        <a href="mailto:chattyclient@gmail.com">E-Mail</a> are also available.</p>
    
    <p>You can also open a <a href="https://github.com/chatty/chatty/issues">GitHub Issue</a>,
        which contains a template for reporting an issue which you should follow.</p>
    
    <p>Please only contact me via one of the mentioned ways at a time. Reporting
        the same issue in several different places is just confusing and will
        probably hinder the solving of your issue.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="log">Debug Log</a></h2>
    <p>Chatty is writing a debug log, which you can view in two ways:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>While Chatty is running via <code>Extra - Debug Window</code>:
            <ul>
                <li>Log - The main Debug Log (this is usually what you want)</li>
                <li>Irc log - Raw communication with Twitch Chat (has to be enabled)</li>
                <li>FFZ-WS - Raw communication with FFZ Websocket server</li>
                <li>PubSub - Raw communication with Twitch PubSub</li>
                <li>Other - More specialized debug messages, most of which have to be enabled first</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In the Debug files, located in the settings directory</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Debug log files</h3>
    <p>The debug log files are located in the settings directory, in the
        subdirectory <code>debuglogs</code>. While Chatty is running you can use
        the command <code>/openDebugDir</code> to open it directly (or
        <code>/showDebugDir</code> to output it's path).</p>

    <p>The directory contains several rotating files (<code>debug0.log, debug1.log, ..</code>),
            that are not overwritten when Chatty is restarted. Normally
            <code>debug0.log</code> is a good place to start when looking for
            recent information.</p>
